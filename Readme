"Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing" 🔰 and a Virtual Internship under the Cyber Gyan Project, conducted by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), NOIDA.

As part of this training, I worked on a fascinating project titled "Detection of Data Theft and Recovery of Data Using Memory Dump." This project involved analyzing a memory dump provided by a victim to uncover secrets about any malicious activities that had occurred. The core objectives were to identify stolen data, detect any malware used for the theft, and overcome anti forensic techniques. Using a set of open-source tools and techniques, I successfully recovered the compromised data.

The domain of this project was Digital Forensics (Disk Forensics)🔰

Throughout this journey, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of tools and techniques, including Volatility, Autopsy, FTK Imager, CyberCheckSuite These tools were instrumental in achieving the project's objectives.

A big thank you to the Ministry of Electronics & IT, Government of India, and all the mentors and instructors at C-DAC for this incredible opportunity.

This experience has significantly broadened my knowledge in digital forensics and ethical hacking, and I'm excited to apply these skills in future endeavors.👩🏻‍💻
